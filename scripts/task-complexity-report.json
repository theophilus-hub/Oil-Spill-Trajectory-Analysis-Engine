      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the data models implementation task into 5 subtasks, focusing on each core model (SpillConfig, EnvironmentalData, Particle, SimulationResults) separately, plus a subtask for interface definitions and validation utilities. Include validation requirements and type specifications for each.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires careful design of data structures with proper validation and interfaces. Medium complexity due to the need for type hints, validation logic, and ensuring the models will work together coherently across modules."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the data acquisition module development into 6 subtasks, with one for each external API integration (OpenWeatherMap, NOAA data services, USGS, NOAA ADIOS), one for the unified interface implementation, and one for caching and fallback mechanisms. Include error handling requirements for each API.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to integration with multiple external APIs, each with different formats and requirements. Includes error handling, retry logic, caching mechanisms, and fallback strategies, all of which add significant complexity."

Include testing criteria for each algorithm component.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to the specialized algorithms needed for land-based flow modeling. Requires understanding of terrain analysis, cost-distance algorithms, and handling transitions between different models. Performance optimization with large datasets adds complexity."

      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity as it involves implementing multiple export formats, but the task is well-defined with clear deliverables. The main challenge is ensuring consistent formatting and proper metadata inclusion across different export types."
